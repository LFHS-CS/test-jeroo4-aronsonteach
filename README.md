Write code to have a single Jeroo start at (0,0) facing East.
Then, have it hop 5 spaces, plant a flower, and hop once more so you can see the flower.

IMPORTANT:  You can only use:
* ```hop()```
* ```plant()```


SeeOn https://jeroo.org, you will have to first write the following:

    method main() {
    
    }
and then put your code inside of this main method.

When it is working on https://jeroo.org, click on the "Work in Repl.it" button inside of the github project.

Copy the code that you wrote inside of the "method main" into the ```runJerooCode()``` method inside of Main.java.

You can try to run it in repl.it and see if it passes the test program.

When you've seen that it works in repl.it,  select the version control tab. Enter a description of what you changed and click on the commit&push button.

Your code should now be stored online at your github account.
